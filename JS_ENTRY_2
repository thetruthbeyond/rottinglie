They've been drilling around some parts of town.
We aren't allowed to even go near cause they got most of the area set for checkpoints and lockdown.
Why would the military be in our town?
What are they drilling for?
They just tell us "It is classified information that we can not tell you at this time." what the hell classified information would there be in this town?
Theres only 5000 or so residents.
This isn't right.
